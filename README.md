## Description

LaTeX is a document-preparation programming language. It takes a "plain" text file and converts it into a high-quality pdf document for printing or on-screen viewing, and as such can be seen as a replacement for Microsoft Word or Microsoft Powerpoint. LaTeX is especially suited to scientists, and has been used in many fields for decades. This course aims at providing a practic
al introduction to some uses a scientist may have of LaTeX: producing a high-quality preprint or supplementary appendix, using journal-provided templates for preparing a manuscript before submission, quickly setting up slides for a presentation, setting up an answer to reviewers. Templates will be supplied for direct use and we will cover some basic features such as segmentation, tables, figures, and referencing.

## Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to use the LaTeX language to create high-quality documents for day
-to-day use in science.
